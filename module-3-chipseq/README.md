# ChIP-sequencing
This module covers the background and analysis pipeline behind looking at ChIP-sequencing data: a technique that combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. It is taught by Professor Alon Goren, an Associate Professor in the UCSD School of Medicine (https://goren-lab.github.io/).

Before the first day of lecture, students will need to install `ssh` and IGV locally, on their laptops. Please follow [these instructions](chipseq_setup.md).
